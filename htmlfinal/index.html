<!--
For my final assignment I continued to build off of my work from assignment 4.
I created a fixed footer to solve my spacing issues I had with my previous version.
I also added the information I said I would in assignment 4.
Lastly I renamed the "About" to "Why" because I felt this name was more fitting.

  <div>Olive oil is very nice, and I enjoy consuming it. So I am making a webpage about it.<br>Olive Oil is my best friend in the kitchen there are so many uses for it.<br>I believe it does not get the appreciation it deserves, and so I made a website for it.<br> <br> It's one of those ingredients that plays nice with others, but can also be strong on its own.<br>There are very few things that are better than dipping some nice freshly baked bread with butter into some olive oil.<br>It is truly a great taste.<br>I have a great love and respect for this amazing invention, and hopefully you will too.</div>
