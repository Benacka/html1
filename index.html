    I like the idea of having a wheel on the page, something interacive would be great.
    I also feel like a wheel is the perfect object because as you see it slow down, the suspense grows, and many enjoy that.
    The customization feature is also neat, if I could work that in then I would happy.

    I like this random song generator for a few reasons. Firstly, the concept behind it.
    You get random songs that can take you to their song on spotify.
    They also display images of the songs. I am a fan of this visual aspect. Lastly, I like how uniformed the photos are.
    I like the idea of having songs show up, and it would be a useful tool to have paired with my idea.

	<h3><u>Other Pages</u></h3>
	<!--I know lines should not be this long, but it was so you could see that I know how to use breaks-->
	<p>Page 1) This will be the main page, it will contain the wheel and the spinning option.<br>Page 2) This will be where you can find music of the randomized style. This will include links to that style of music.<br>Page 3) This will be where you can customize the wheel, inserting your own choices into it. Naturally this will make the example portion unavailable</p>
	<p>I want to add a way of navigating to these pages using some type of menu at the top of the website.</p>
	
	<h3><u>Targeted Audience</u></h3>
	<p>
	My target is the <b>music</b> community. I know that fellow composers have also struggled deciding on a style of music to write in.
	Hopefully this website will provide a solution to this problem.
